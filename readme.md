# Ray Tracing In a Weekend
[Ray Tracing In A Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), not done in a weekend and converted to template functions.

It's been a long while since I've written C++ so I wanted to see how it would feel. Turns out I'm not as rusty as I anticipated, though my general programming standard is still low.

If I can be bothered, I want to make it multi-threaded either on the CPU or GPU.
